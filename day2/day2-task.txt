Window:
All the things including the tab of the browser is part of window object which is considered as a global one.
Window object can control the document object.

Document:
Document is the UI of the web page or the part excluding tab of the browser.
All the html structure and the styles of it are part of document object.
Document object cannot control the full window object.


Day-1 questions:
1. Difference between http1.1 and http 2

http1.1 loads the resources one by one

2. Internal representation of Objects in javascript
Objects can store all date type values using ' key: "value" ' pairs. All the data related to one can be grouped into object using this feature.
Object's key and values are iterable.
Assigning the object copies the 'reference of the object properties instead of copying the values like primitive data types.
Object values can be modified using '.' notation or by [] notation.
